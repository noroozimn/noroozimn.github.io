HubPress offers a number of themes you can use to customise your blog.

If you plan to create a developer blog with plenty of code samples, you should try the uno or saga themes first.

These themes have the best code block support out of all the shipped themes.

That doesn’t mean you can’t customise the other themes to add highlighter support, but these will get you started blogging quicker.
